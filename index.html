    V0.6    SOUND

    FUTURE RELEASE
    --------------
    v1.0 - FULL PLAYABLE BUGS FIXED - TBA - WILL ROUGHLY REPLICATE THE ARCADE GAME. ENEMY MOVEMENT WILL PROBABLY BE DIFFERENT

    BUGS
    ----
    HOLDING JUMP WILL MAKE YOU SLOWLY FLOAT TO THE GROUND - SHOULD ONLY COUNT THE JUMP IF THE USER LETS GO OF JUMP BEFORE ATTEMPTING A NEW JUMP

    WTFS
    ----
    ROBOT FALLING FROM FIRST PLATFORM (ON LEVEL 1) DOES NOT EVOLVE FOR SOME REASON  <---- THIS NO LONGER HAPPENS. I MAY HAVE FIXED IT ACCIDENTALLY WHILST FIXING SOME OTHER BUG.... SO WEIRD
