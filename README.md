Test Edition of BombJack - Not Suitable For Human Consumption... yet.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Beta 2.0</b><br/>
Implementing Hi Score stuff<br/>
<br/>
<b>STILL TO DO:</b><br/>
Allow game to restart after player runs out of lives.<br/>
    Easiest way to do this now that hi scores are being saved to local storage is simply to refresh the page. Totally unprofessional but       will do just now.
