Test Edition of BombJack - Not Suitable For Human Consumption... yet.<br/>
<br/>
<b>ALPHA 1.0 - Completed 26/3/20</b><br/>
<b>BETA 2.0</b><br/>
Implementing Hi Score stuff<br/>
<br/>
<b>STILL TO DO:</b><br/>
<ul><li>Allow game to restart after player runs out of lives.<br/>
    Easiest way to do this now that hi scores are being saved to local storage is simply to refresh the page. Totally unprofessional but will do just now.</li><li>Implement new way to decide where walkers will spawn</li></ul>
